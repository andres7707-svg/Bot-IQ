## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

|----------|---------------|-------------|
| MODE | PRACTICE | PRACTICE or REAL |
| RISK_PER_TRADE | 0.01 | Risk 1% of balance per trade |
| MIN_STAKE | 1.0 | Minimum $1 bet |

| MAX_LOSSES_IN_ROW | 5 | Stop after 5 consecutive losses |

To modify: Go to Replit Secrets panel or set environment variables

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Known Limitations
1. **API Connection Issues**: The IQ Option API can be unstable. You'll see "error get_candles need reconnect" messages - this is normal. The bot retries automatically.

2. **OTC Market Hours**: OTC markets have specific operating hours. Connection errors may occur when markets are closed.

3. **Conservative Strategy**: The current strategy is very selective (needs EMA crossover + RSI confirmation + volume spike). This means fewer trades but potentially higher quality signals.

### Safety Warnings
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Martingale Risk**: The recovery system can increase losses quickly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Test First**: Always test in PRACTICE mode extensively
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Monitor Closely**: Check the bot regularly, especially with real money
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Start Small**: Use small MIN_STAKE values when switching to REAL mode

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Bot not executing trades?
- This is normal - the strategy is conservative and waits for strong signals
- Markets may be closed or low volatility
- Check console logs for "Signal call/put on..." messages

### Too many connection errors?
- Reduce the number of assets monitored
- Set ASSETS environment variable to fewer pairs: `EURUSD-OTC,GBPUSD-OTC`

### Want to modify strategy?
- Edit `strategy.py` - the `simple_otc_1m()` function
- Current logic: EMA crossover + RSI filter + volume confirmation

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance**: Let it run in PRACTICE mode and check trades_log.csv
2. **Adjust Parameters**: Fine-tune risk settings based on results
3. **Optimize Strategy**: Modify strategy.py if needed
4. **Go Live** (Optional): Only after extensive testing, set MODE=REAL
