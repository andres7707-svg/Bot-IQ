## Architecture

### Core Files
1. **main.py** - Main orchestrator with auto-reconnection and stop conditions
2. **strategy.py** - Advanced pattern recognition and indicator analysis
   - `PatternMatcher` class: Historical pattern matching with similarity detection
   - `CandlePatterns` class: Candlestick pattern recognition
   - `Indicators` class: EMA, RSI, MACD, Support/Resistance
   - `AdvancedStrategy` class: Combines all analysis with scoring system

3. **manager.py** - Trade execution and money management
   - Martingale progression system
   - State persistence (bot_state.json)
   - Take profit / max loss logic
   - Accurate profit/loss accounting

4. **connector.py** - IQ Option API connection
   - Handles digital/binary options
   - Auto-detects OTC assets
   - Error handling and delays

### Data Files
- `trades_log.csv` - Complete trade history with P/L tracking
- `bot_state.json` - Current bot state (resume after crash)

## Trade Cycle Logic

1. **Entry Signal Detection**
   - Scans all OTC assets every 5 seconds
   - Analyzes last 120 candles
   - Calculates pattern score (bullish/bearish)
   - Executes if score ‚â• 5 and conditions align

2. **Trade Execution**
   - Places trade with current stake amount
   - Waits 65s for 1-minute trade to close
   - Checks result (win/loss/unknown)

3. **Post-Trade Actions**
   - **WIN**: Add 80% profit, reset stake to BASE_AMOUNT
   - **LOSS**: Subtract stake, multiply stake by MARTINGALE_MULTIPLIER
   - Update pattern history with result
   - Save state to disk
   - Check stop conditions

4. **Stopping Conditions**
   - Total profit ‚â• TAKE_PROFIT ‚Üí Stop with success
   - Consecutive losses ‚â• MAX_LOSSES ‚Üí Stop for safety
   - Manual stop (Ctrl+C)

## Known Issues & Limitations
1. **API Connection Stability**: IQ Option API can be unstable with frequent requests
2. **OTC Market Hours**: Markets have specific hours; errors occur when closed
3. **Conservative Strategy**: High entry requirements mean fewer but higher-quality trades
4. **Martingale Risk**: Can quickly increase losses - always test in PRACTICE first

## Safety Recommendations
1. ‚úÖ **Test Extensively**: Run in PRACTICE mode for days/weeks
2. ‚úÖ **Start Small**: Use minimal BASE_AMOUNT when going live
3. ‚úÖ **Monitor Closely**: Check logs and performance regularly
4. ‚úÖ **Set Limits**: Configure reasonable TAKE_PROFIT and MAX_LOSSES
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never Risk More**: Than you can afford to lose
